# Perimeter-Calculation-using-Bump-Sensors-and-Rotarty-Encoders-of-3Pi-Robot

The aim of this study was to determine how viable the bump sensors and rotary encoders of Pololu 3Pi+ robot are for distance measurement. I evaluated its performance by analysing the perimeter of a box with the use of bump sensors and then by removing the plastic cover of the robot and measuring the same data with the help of IR sensors
